# 🔐 Brute Force Login Detection with SIEM

## 📖 Overview
This project simulates brute force login attempts against user accounts and demonstrates how to detect, investigate, and respond using Splunk (SPL).


---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate brute force login attempts to test detection capabilities.  
- Create SPL queries to identify login anomalies and excessive authentication failures.  
- Implement account lockout policies and recommend multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- Map detection logic to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** and tune alert thresholds.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk (SPL)** – for log analysis and anomaly detection  
- **Account Lockout Policies** – to mitigate brute force attempts  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – for enhanced resilience
